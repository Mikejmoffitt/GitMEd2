Ghost in the Machine Level Format

Basically it is a big mess of CSV. Comma ',' is the delimeter.

The trailing comma is important. I think I fixed it, but at some point my terrible
parser complained about the missing delimiter at the end. Just play it safe and
include it. This 

Line 0 is meta-data in the following format:

	{levelName},{levelAuthor},{levelSecretText},

Following line 0 is the start of Layer 0 data.

A layer's maximum width and height is 224 x 224.

Layer 0 data looks like this:

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,

so on and so forth. To end the layer is a line containing 'X':


0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,
X

after that is layer 1, stopped with an 'X' again. Layer 2 is terminated that way too. 
Anything after layer 2 doesn't matter, put whatever you want there, comments,
I don't care. 

With that squared away, here are the definitions for the values in each layer:

Layer 0 (background):
0 - Empty
1 - Wall
2 - Backpipe
3 - Pillar
4 - Right conveyor belt
5 - Left conveyor belt
6 - Diamondplate
7 - Start tile (should only be one, if the game sees more than one it uses the last)
8 - End tile (same as above)

Layer 1 (sprites):
0 - Empty
1 - Not used (undefined behavior I guess)
2 - Bear trap
3 - Normally open downwards door (extend downwards for door lengths)
4 - Normally closed downwards door
5 - Switch (low)
6 - Switch (med)
7 - Switch (high)
8 - Spikes
9 - Piston top
10 - Piston top (half-tile shifted)
11 - Piston
12 - Piston (half-tile shifted)
13 - Normally open left door
14 - Normally closed left door
15 through 19 undefined ( don't use them, I may fill them later )
20 - Normally open right door
21 - Normally closed right door

Layer 2 (extra):
0 - Empty
1 - Water tile
2 - Background waterfall
3 - Foreground waterfall

Tiles in-game are 16 x 16 pixels.
